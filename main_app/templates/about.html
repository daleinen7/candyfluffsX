  <h1>Hello my lovelies~</h1>
  <p>
    I'm just a girl that loves to draw manga! I am an illustrator that grew up
    on manga and I'll forever be influenced by Sailor Moon, Skip Beat, Nao
    Tsukiji, and classic manga like Glass Mask.
  </p>
  <p>
    This all started as a hobby, but as I started to focus more on manga and
    post things on Tumblr I realized there are people that really like my work.
    So this shop is a direct result of that. I hope you see some thing you like
    and join me on my journey!
